## Pros of Test-driven development
Test-driven development is a great way to help organize code into parts. The parts can be individually tested, which allows for easier debugging and maintainability. Furthermore, test-driven development can help programmers understand their code better, by making them think more about what kind of outputs they expect.

## Cons of Test-driven development
Test-driven development can be very time-consuming. The tests themselves may need to be debugged. This would cost additional resources. Furthermore, for team projects, some team members may not be accustomed to test-driven development.
